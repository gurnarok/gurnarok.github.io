   abstract = {This project aims to provide well-written and easy-to-follow documentation for exporting users’ models from SolidWorks to ROS, for continued development and testing, providing feedback for the mechanical engineers, if their design works or if it needs improvements. This is mainly aimed at mechanical engineering students, but it can be also used in electrical and automation engineering, for students that have prior skills with SolidWorks modelling or are working on a project with mechanical engineers, creating a set of design guidelines to make the project run smoother. The documentation is shared as a website, which is created using Jekyll static site generator framework and hosted in GitHub Pages, with added automation through CI/CD scripts to automatically generate the webpages, making everything easier to update and modify.},
